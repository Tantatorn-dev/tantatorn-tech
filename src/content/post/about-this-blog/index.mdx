Hello fellas. I don't know to what to write for my first blog. Well then, let's write about how I make this blog.
I intend to use this blog to convey my thoughts on various topics I'm interested in. I did have a blog before, but it's
on a platform like Medium. I don't like the idea of having my content on a platform I don't own. So, I decided to make
my own blog.

## Toolbox

Let's talk about the main tool I use to make this site. I've just heard about Astro lately. There is an increasing adoption
of Astro for content-focused website, especially for blog. I suppose this is my turn to give it a try.

In this blog I'll share my experience using Astro to supercharge this blog. I love the philosophy of Astro. It's a framework that compiles your
site to static HTML, CSS, and JS. It's fast, secure, and SEO-friendly. It's also framework agnostic. You can use any framework
you want. You can have a React component, Vue component residing in the same page. It's also shipped with a lot of themes
to get you started. I'm using [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus).

Before we dive in, let me tell you a little bit about Astro Islands. This is a pattern that originated from
Astro. Let's view each components in a page as an island. Highly interactive components is like an island in the midst
of the sea of static html. It's a great way to improve your site performance drastically. You can read more about it. [Here](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)

## Getting started

Let's get started. First, you need to install Astro (template is optional). You can install it using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
```

For VSCode user like me, you can install the Astro extension. [Find it here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode)

## Astro component

Astro component is a HTML-only templating component with no client-side runtime. Its file extension is `.astro`.
Most of your components in Astro will be Astro component.

Astro components consist of 2 part.

1. Component Script
2. Template

Let me show you an example.

```astro
---
// Component Script
import MyComponent from "@/components/MyComponent";
---

<div>
	<MyComponent />
</div>
```

The component script is runned at server side. It's where you can import your component, data, or any other logic.
The template is the HTML part of the component. It's where you can write your HTML.

### Pass props to component

You can pass props to component like this.

```astro
---
// Pokemon.astro
const { pokemon } = Astro.props;
---

<h1>{pokemon}</h1>
```

```astro
---
// Pokemon component usage
---

<Pokemon pokemon="Pikachu" />
```

### Slot

In Astro, there is a slot too like existing in Svelte. You can use it like this.

```astro
---
// Wrapper.astro
---

<div id="wrapper">
	<slot />
</div>
```

```astro
---
// usage of Wrapper component
---

<Wrapper>
	<h1>Hello World</h1>
</Wrapper>
```

## Add React component

Let's say you've already have all static stuffs in your site. It's time to add some interactivity to your site.
You can add React component to your Astro site. Astro itself is also supports other framework like Vue, Svelte, etc.
You can view the list of supported framework [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/).

Let's add a React component to our site. First, we need to install React. Integration with React is pretty straightforward.
You can run this command to install React.

```bash
npx astro add react
```

After that, you can add React component to your Astro site. Let's say you have a React component called `Counter`.

```jsx
// Counter.jsx
export default function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>add</button>
			<h1>Count: {count}</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
```

You can import it to your Astro component like this.

```astro
---
// Counter.astro
import Counter from "@/components/Counter.jsx";
---

<div>
	<Counter client:only />
</div>
```

Disclaimer: You need to add `client:only` to your component if you use a hook like `useState` or `useEffect`. It's because
those hooks are not supported in server side.

## Summary

That's all for now. I believe this is enough to get you started with Astro.
I'd love to see everyone do more blogging stuffs (including me). Blogging is a great way to
improve my understanding of a topic. See you in the next blog.
