Hello fellas. I don't know to what to write for my first blog. Well then, let's write about how I make this blog.
I intend to use this blog to convey my thoughts on various topics I'm interested in. I did have a blog before, but it's
on a platform like Medium. I don't like the idea of having my content on a platform I don't own. So, I decided to make
my own blog.

## Toolbox

Let's talk about the main tool I use to make this site. I've just heard about Astro lately. There is an increasing adoption
of Astro for content-focused website, especially for blog. I suppose this is my turn to give it a try.

In this blog I'll share my experience using Astro to supercharge this blog. I love the philosophy of Astro. It's a framework that compiles your
site to static HTML, CSS, and JS. It's fast, secure, and SEO-friendly. It's also framework agnostic. You can use any framework
you want. You can have a React component, Vue component residing in the same page. It's also shipped with a lot of themes
to get you started. I'm using [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus).

## Getting started

Let's get started. First, you need to install Astro (template is optional). You can install it using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
```
