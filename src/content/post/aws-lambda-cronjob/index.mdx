In this post, we will create a simple cron job for sending daily book highlights to Line Messenger App using AWS Lambda.
Nowadays, there're many ways to create a cron job, you can have your own server and use `cron` or `node-cron` to schedule the job,
or you can use serverless services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions to create a cron job.
The latter is more cost-effective and easier to maintain, so we will use AWS Lambda for this post.
